# Hi, I'm Kyryl Zuiev! 👋

## About Me
👨‍💻 I'm a developer with a passion for neural network architectures. Currently, I'm deeply involved in studying Capsule Neural Networks and exploring the visualization of hierarchies within these systems.

## Current Studies and Research
🧠 Focusing on Capsule Neural Networks, which promise a more structured approach to machine learning, especially in understanding spatial hierarchies. I'm particularly interested in how visualizing these hierarchies can provide deeper insights into network decisions.

## Skills
- 🤖 Machine Learning, Capsule Neural Networks, Robotics
